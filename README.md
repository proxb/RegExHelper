# RegExHelper
A UI to help with writing Regular Expressions.

This is a UI built using PowerShell and WPF that allows for simple Regular Expression checking by displaying the results in real time.

Currently this only supports a string match but future versions will allow for locating patterns in a log file or similiar groups of text.

Feedback and improvements are always welcome! This is the Dev branch where I would like to improve performance on the log RegEx portion (2nd tab). Currently the 2nd tab is not working properly (this is Dev of course :) ) due to something I did between now and when I started troubleshooting the performance issue.
